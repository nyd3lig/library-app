<h1>Library APP Project from The Odin Project Curriculum</h1>
<p>This project came just after reading about prototypes, and I am kind of sad that I was not able to implement the use of them anywhere. But as I was working I kept seeing glimpses of where they could be useful, but when it came to implementation I came up short.</p>

<p>However, I got a great deal of practice on DOM manipulation here, and targeting different aspects of things, shot myself in the foot a couple of times targeting classes as singles, not taking into account that when more items gets added they will collide.</p>

<p>I also spent an uncomfortable amount of time trying to figure out the toggle button, and getting that to behave as I wanted, there were times where I was considering just dropping the entire toggle button idea, but I really wanted it in the design, and I am happy I stuck it out because I do feel like this type of button fits nicely</p>
